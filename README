# RSA Encrypt message

RSA encryption is a crucial asymmetric encryption algorithm used for secure communication. It involves encrypting messages with a recipient's public key, ensuring that only the recipient possessing the corresponding private key can decrypt and read the message. This process ensures confidentiality and privacy in data transmission over insecure channels.
